#TL FingerBoom
####Chrome Extension to bring [teamliquid.net](http://teamliquid.net) into the modern age. No tables for layout, HTML6 and CSS4. And explosions! Boom.

This is still very much a work in progress, install at your own risk!

##Folder Structure
* **./extension** - Contains extension specific files
* **./js** - Contains JavaScript files that get compiled into ./extension/fingerboom.js using [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify)
